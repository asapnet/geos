# NOTE: Make sure that 'source' appears first.
# 'capi' and 'doc' surely rely on availability of libgeos
# which is built under 'source' and it seems that automake
# is not able to detect required build order but blindly
# relies on the order items in SUBDIRS appear.

SUBDIRS = 	\
	source	\
	capi	\
	doc	\
	macros	\
	swig	\
	tests	\
